/**
 * PurchaseOrder â€“ JPA entity representing a supplier order in the system.
 *
 * Concepts:
 * - Each instance represents a distinct order a business has placed with a supplier for inventory products.
 * - Captures supplier, financial, scheduling, and status information.
 * - Demonstrates JPA entity modeling with relations, auditing, status enums, and total calculations.
 * 
 * Lombok:
 * - @Data: reduces boilerplate by auto-generating getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
 * 
 * JPA Annotations:
 * - @Entity: Marks this class as a JPA entity to be persisted in the database.
 * - @Table: Specifies the database table name for this entity.
 *
 * Relationships:
 * - Many-to-one to Supplier (multiple orders per supplier)
 * - Many-to-one to User (who created the order)
 * - One-to-many to PurchaseOrderItem (each order may contain multiple line items)
