/**
 * LoginResponse â€“ DTO representing successful authentication details.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Sent to the client after successful user authentication (upon login or token refresh).
 * - Provides both the access token (for client to use in future secure requests)
 *   and several user details (for UI and context).
 *
 * Lombok:
 * - @Data           : Generates getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
 * - @Builder        : Enables fluent object construction pattern for cleaner instantiation.
 * - @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor: Ensures flexible object creation by frameworks, 
 *                    mappers, or manual instantiation.
 *
 * API Security Note:
 * - The token should be handled securely on the client (stored in memory, secure local storage, 
 *   or httpOnly cookie).
 * - Exposing user id/email is often useful for client-side displays and role-based controls.
